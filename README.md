This is my code to Learn C# collection from Microsoft learn that will give me certification `Foundational C# with Microsoft` from freecodecamp.org. I organize the folder based on the 6 learning path in this Learn C# collection. In each learning path folder, I organize it based on the modules on those learning path. The organization folder will look like this
```
<x>. <Learning Path Name>
	<x>. <modul name>
		notes.md
		project folder
```
